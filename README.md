## What is Trustpoint Client?

Trustpoint Client allows you to onboard devices to Trustpoint, which encompasses retrieving the trust store, and requesting and downloading a digital identity (LDevID) and its associated certificate chain.
All you need is a command line interface on your device, and a recent version of python.

> [!WARNING]
> Please only onboard devices to your network you are sure you can trust.
